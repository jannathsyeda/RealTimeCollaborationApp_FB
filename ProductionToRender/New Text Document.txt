Backend deploy------------

Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended - Easier)
Instead of using a Blueprint, do a manual Web Service deployment:
Steps:

Go back to Render Dashboard: Click the Render logo or go to https://dashboard.render.com/
Click "New +" button (top right) → Select "Web Service"
Connect your GitHub repository:

If not connected, click "Connect account"
Find and select: jannathsyeda/RealTimeCollaborationApp_FB


Configure the deployment:

Name: colaborationApp (or any name you like)
Region: Choose closest to you
Branch: master
Root Directory: Backend (since your server is in backend folder)
Runtime: Node
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: node server.js
Instance Type: Free


Add Environment Variables:
Click "Advanced" → Add Environment Variable:

   MONGODB_URI = your_mongodb_connection_string
   NODE_ENV = production
   FRONTEND_URL = http://localhost:5173
(You'll update FRONTEND_URL after deploying frontend to render)

Click "Create Web Service"
Wait for deployment - Takes 2-5 minutes

Deploy Frontend on Render
Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard

Click "New +" → Select "Static Site"

Step 2: Connect Repository

Step 3: Configure Frontend Deployment
Fill in these settings:

Name: colaborationapp-frontend (or any name)
Branch: master
Root Directory: Frontend/my-project
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: dist

Step 4: Add Environment Variable
Click "Advanced" → Add Environment Variable:
VITE_API_BASE = https://realtimecollaborationapp-fb.onrender.com
```

### Step 5: Deploy

Click **"Create Static Site"**

Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment.

## After Deployment

### Update Backend CORS

1. Go to your **backend service** on Render
2. Click **"Environment"**
3. Update `FRONTEND_URL`:
```
   FRONTEND_URL = https://colaborationapp-frontend.onrender.com
(Use your actual frontend URL from Render)
4. Save (will auto-redeploy backend)
